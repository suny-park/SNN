# Random connections support precise top-down modulations of early sensory cortex

Scripts used to simulate top-down feature-based attention in spiking neural network models.


**run_srnn_iter_feature.py**

A wrapper script that can change network and task properties. This script calls functions in `srnn_iter_feature.py` that actually execute the simulations.


**srnn_iter_feature.py**

Script containing functions needed for the simulations.


**analyze_feature.py**

Analyzes output files from `run_srnn_iter_feature.py` and saves summarized `.mat` files.


**plotSNN.m**

Plots figures.
